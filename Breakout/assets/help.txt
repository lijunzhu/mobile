When the player starts a game a welcome screen lets the player select whether he or she wants to start a new game, download a new level from the server via a http connection, open a local level, access the game rules in form of a help screen, see the current (top 10) high scores, or end the game. If the user has to wait, for example, while downloading a level, the program needs to show a progress bar. Similarly, in case of exceptional circumstances, such as an unavailable connection to the server or a game level that cannot be properly initiated (due to a mistake in the level design), the program should provide appropriate feedback to the player.
